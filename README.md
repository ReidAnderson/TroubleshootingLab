# ITEC 2585 Week 3 Lab: Troubleshooting

## Lab Instructions

I have provided a simple solution that contains two projects, the code for a calculator class and tests for that class. You will not have to submit any changes for the code or tests for this lab. You need to run the tests, debug, and analyze the code to answer the lab questions.

- Go to Module 3 in D2L and download Troubleshooting.zip
- Unzip the file and open the solution in Visual Studio
- Make sure that the solution builds and the tests pass
- Answer the Lab Questions below, submit your answers as a text file, pdf, or Word document on D2L

## Lab Questions

1. What would the result of the following call be? `Calculate(1234567, 302)`
2. Set a breakpoint on Line 59 of ArbitraryCalculator.cs (`this.numberOfCalculations++;`). Debug the GetsResult unit test. What is the value of `result` at this line when i=3 and j=2?
3. What is a link to Microsoft documentation for the `%` operator?
4. What is the value of `testResult` at the end of the `ChecksNumberOfOperations` test? (line 54 of ArbitraryCalculatorTests.cs)
5. Is there a line of code that is never reached by the tests? If so, what line and how can you prove it?

## Lab Grading

The lab overall will be worth 30 points.
